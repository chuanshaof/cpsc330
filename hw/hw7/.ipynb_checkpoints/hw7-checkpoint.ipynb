    "\n",
    "In this exercise you'll prepare the data for topic modeling using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). Preprocessing is a crucial step before training an LDA model and it markedly affects topic modeling results. So let's carry out preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Write code to carry out preprocessing of the \"text\" column in the dataframe above and store the preprocessed text in a new column called \"text_pp\" in the dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no such thing as \"perfect\" preprocessing. You'll have to make your own judgments and decisions on which tokens are more informative and which ones are less informative for the given task. Some common text preprocessing steps for topic modeling are: \n",
    "- getting rid of slashes or other weird characters\n",
    "- sentence segmentation and tokenization      \n",
    "- getting rid of urls and email addresses\n",
    "- getting rid of other fairly unique tokens which are not going to help us in topic modeling  \n",
    "- excluding stopwords and punctuation \n",
    "- lemmatization        \n",
    "\n",
    "You might have to go back and forth between the preprocessing and topic modeling and interpretation steps in the next exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Check out [these available attributes](https://spacy.io/api/token#attributes) for `token` in spaCy which might help you with preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You can also get rid of words with specific POS tags. [Here](https://spacy.io/api/annotation/#pos-en) is the list of part-of-speech tags used in spaCy. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that preprocessing the corpus might take some time. So here are a couple of suggestions: 1) During the debugging phase, work on a smaller subset of the data. 2) Once you're done with the preprocessing part, you might want to save the preprocessed data so that you don't run the preprocessing part every time you run the notebook. \n"
